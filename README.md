Duck (Working title) is a roguelike top-down wave shooter where you, as a determined duck, must defend your nest from relentless hunters. Arm yourself with powerful weapons, unlock upgrades, and prepare to face the final boss!


<!-- ## Features 
Need a features tab. Possibly talking about the game loop and the different weapons and upgrades?

## Team
We are the Studio 5+6 Games Team! We are a team in our third year at the Bachelor of Information Technology in Otago Polytechnic. The game started development in late 2023 and has been in active development since then. In July, the team experienced a shuffle, with two developers moving to another project and one new developer joining.
