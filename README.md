A rouge-like top down shooter.

## Synopsis
You're a duck defending your nest from hunters and their dogs from killing you. 
The objective is to live as long and get as many points as you can. 

## Road Map
We are a student development team and we aren't working on this game 24/7, so development will be slow but we are commited to making this game better over time.

Head over to the [Releases Tab](https://github.com/BIT-Studio-4/Duck-Game/releases) and pick a version to download. Click on the DuckGame-VX.X.X.zip file to download. Extract the files somewhere and run the StandaloneWindows.exe.
